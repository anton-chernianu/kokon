## Project goals

The goal of the project is to create a lightweight and user-friendly macOS app for extracting archives, especially RAR files. After failing to find suitable free and open-source solutions, I decided to develop my own, focusing on simplicity, speed, and reliability.

In the future, I plan to add new features based on user feedback to make the app even more useful.
